Sapphire Editor is an UI editor for Sapphire related features. Supports Web, Windows, Linux, Mac, Android and iOS.
Currently, it only functions as a prototype for encounter timeline editing.

It is a **research project** to learn how retail servers work and currently not production code. You should expect a lot of things unimplemented or broken.

Contributions are always welcome.
